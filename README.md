The more information you share, the more effectively we can detect mental health conditions which could save lives. • Procedure: This survey will only take around 5 minutes to complete. You will be asked to answer questions, record samples of your voice, and share phone/social media data. No private messages will be collected. • Privacy: All information you give will be stored anonymously on a secure server and will not be tied to you. • Voluntary/Risk: You can share as much or little data as you would like and you may stop the study at any time.”  ”Between the demographic survey and the text prompt, the Android app asked for permission to collect text logs, call logs, contacts, and calendar entries stored on the phone. After the audio, the Android app participants could also share their GPS history stored by their Google account. The last modality of both apps asked students to share their Twitter usernames so we could collect publicly available tweets. While we only collected the willingness to share tweets, this approach allows us to determine the willingness of students to have this modality used for screening purposes.

Utterances were tagged for mentions of personal names, specific dates, addresses, schools, places of employment, and locations that can be used to narrow down an event. Utterances were not considered to be personally identifying if they only included large locations (e.g. “I live in Santa Monica”), very large institutions (“I served in the Marines”), or non- specific dates such as age in years. De-identification was performed independently by two annotators, and differ- ences were reconciled by a senior annotator.

Participants were also asked if they had ever been treated in an emergency department. In the remaining questions, participants were asked to label their willingness to disclose different data modalities and PHQ-9 scores on a Likert scale ranging from Completely Unwilling, Somewhat Unwilling, Unsure, Somewhat Willing, to Completely Willing. In the survey, participants were first asked for their willingness to disclose data from social media accounts to medical personnel. These types of data included their Twitter username, Twitter tweets, Facebook Posts, and messages on applications such as GroupeMe, Discord, and WhatsApp. The second group of questions surveyed the willingness to disclose retrospective data stored on a typical smartphone such as GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, browser history, call logs, and app usage logs. Finally, we surveyed their willingness to record a phrase and capture an image of their face.” |

Unbalanced datasets will introduce non-depressed preference to the trained clas- sification models. Therefore, the sizes of the depressed and non- depressed classes need to be balanced before training. In this work, resampling is utilized to address the data imbalance issue.”  ”For EATD-Corpus, the method of rearranging volunteers’ re- sponses is adopted to increase the size of the depressed class. The orders of three responses are rearranged and these rearranged re- sponses are resampled to create new training samples.Because there are 6 ways of response rearrangement for each individual, the size of the depressed class can be enlarged 6 times.”                              | No             | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Based on the research literature on depression, we expect that the interpersonal nature of clinical interviews would improve the distinguishability across modalities [7].”  ”The audio recorder was placed on the desk at a distance of approximately 60cm. During the semi-structural interview, the interviewer and interviewee sat face to face. The audio was low pass filtered at 75 kHz, and the frame rate of video recording was 50 fps. All subjects were recorded using the same software and hardware apparatus. Though MDD and HC subjects were recorded at different sites, the room set- ting is the same (both are electromagnetic shielding rooms). Mobile phones were turned off or set to flight mode before recording. Participants were asked to avoid touching the recording stick and table during recording; prior to the key questions, the experimenter recorded for about 3 minutes before the official recording (did not involve the questions provided).

During the experiment, the ambient noise of the lab must be less than 60 dB. The devices we used for recording are Neumann TLM102 (microphones) and RME FIREFACE UCX (audio card), with a 44.1 kHz sampling rate and 24-bit sampling depth. All recording data were saved in uncompressed WAV format. The whole experiment lasted about 25 minutes for one participant. During recording, the participant was asked not to touch any equipment and keep the distance between mouth and microphone about 20 cm. Each participant is invited to complete all three experimental tasks on a comfortable chair. Ambient noise signals were required under 60 dB to prevent interference with the participant’s audio signals.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Yes            | Yes https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854301/  Rehsare platform provides info for mantenaibility (such as last updated etc).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Yes            | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes        | Yes, DSM. ”All MDD patients received a structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)22 that met the diagnostic criteria for major depression of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) based on the DSM-IV”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | No             | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Diagnostic criteria matter for at least two reasons. First, many non-depressive disorders are confusable with depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder, for instance, share overlapping symptoms with depression. Second, people with history of depression may differ from those without depression in personality factors or in other non-specific ways [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5581737/#R40].

Microphone (20 Hz-20 kHz frequency range; 2.5 mV/Pa sensitivity; 600 ohms impedance) is placed between 8 and 14 cm from the mouth of the participant at an approximate angle of 45◦ in order to minimize breathe noise. Experimental terms are standardized to the maximum in order to assure equal conditions for data collection: isolated room; no background noise; same apparatus used with all participants; recording in mono; identical recording technique with all participants. This is particularly important in speech analysis, since some variables (like intensity, which values can depend on physical distance from the microphone) can be highly affected by variations in experimental (and even individual) conditions. “                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | No             | In the paper they just mention “As a complementary material to this paper, we offer a free-access speech corpus of standardized reading samples produced by healthy elderly, speakers with MCI and speakers with mild AD.”  And the dataset is provided as a supplementary material https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885230821001340?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=85fb6f34f90fbae5#sec0019aa.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes            | “All participants underwent previous neuropsychological evaluation including a complete anamnesis, evaluation of daily life activities, as well as psychological and cognitive assessment through Neuronorma Screening Test (Pena ˜ Casanova et al., 2009) and Goldberg Test for depression discrimination.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | No         | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No             | In Section “3.1.

In these sessions, the psychiatrist registers a total of 40 variables. HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale) items are included. Patients are diagnosed more than once monthly (usually every two weeks). Therefore, the variable “diagnosis” is also collected. According to the psychiatrist, a diagnosis should be maintained until changes in the patient’s symptoms occur, that is, until the next diagnosis. The diagnosis is directly related to the HDRS and YMRS tests.

Only two of the participants were given S4s and their data are excluded from this study. The distribution of subjects with S3s and S5s can be seen in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995442/table/T2/. The two models of phone include model-specific microphones and processing. One of the effects of this recording and processing is clipping. Clipping occurs most often in the S3, with an average of 2.74% of speech samples at maximum range. This sensitivity is also demonstrated by the average root mean square value of 0.397 for the S3. Additionally, the noise is much more pronounced, as seen in the lower signal to noise ratio of 21.2 dB for the S3.” “The two phones used in this study have different acoustic properties. The S3, compared to the S5, has more clipping, higher volume, and a sensitivity to background noise. Because of this, it is necessary to carefully preprocess the data before feature extraction using declipping, audio normalization, and noise-robust segmentation in order to make calls from different devices more comparable.”                                                                                                                                                              | No             | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Yes            | “Participants take part in weekly calls with our study clinicians in which the HAMD and YMRS interviews are conducted.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | No         | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No             | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The inter- views were performed by a computer science researcher based on peer-support interview questions collected from the university support services. To achieve the conversa- tional interview dynamic the interviewer asks general ques- tions regarding the participant’s life and further encourages the participant to elaborate. For example, the interviewer would ask “can you tell me about one time in your life you were particularly happy?” and then ask some follow up questions regarding the example the participant provided. The interviewer was blind to the distress level of partici- pants during the interview. To keep behaviors naturalistic, participants were not aware of the main goal of the study, which is an automatic analysis of behavioral cues. Instead, they were told that the experiment aimed at building models that can help in men- tal well-being. This ensured that their behavior would be as natural as possible.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | No             | "To achieve the conversational interview dynamic the interviewer asks general questions regarding the participant’s life and further encourages the participant to elaborate”  Authors just say “To achieve the conversational interview dynamic”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The first consists of reading a short fairy tale written by Aesop, namely “The Wind of the North and the Sun” (the text is provided in the corpus). The main motivation behind the choice of the text, extracted from a textbook for children, is that it is simple. Therefore, it can be read easily irrespective of one’s education level. The IT corresponds to answering a few questions about everyday life (e.g., “What did you do last weekend”) posed by an interviewer instructed to speak as little as possible.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes            | Provided in the description of the discourse genre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

For example: If you have a vacation, please describe your travel plans. What is the best gift you have ever received, and how did you feel? Please describe one of your friends, including age, job, characters, and hobbies. How do you evaluate yourself? What would you like to do when you are unable to fall asleep? What makes you desperate?  2)  Reading: This part consists of a short story named “The North Wind and the Sun”, which is from the booklet “The Principles of the International Phonetic Association”35, and often used in the acoustic analysis in international, multilingual clinical research. And three groups of words with positive (e.g., outstanding, happy), neutral (e.g., center, since), and negative (e.g., depression, wail) emotion. Positive and negative words are selected from the affective ontology corpus created by Hongfei Lin (http://ir.dlut.edu.cn/Group. aspx?ID = 4) and neutral ones are picked out from the Chinese affective words extremum table (http://www.datatang.com/data/43216). These words are often used in Chinese to avoid educational level, and three groups of words have close stroke numbers. Participants are told to read a story and these words in their ordinary ways.  3)  Picture description: The materials for this task include four pictures in all. Three pictures, which express positive, neutral, and negative faces, are selected from the Chinese Facial Affective Picture System (CFAPS), and the last one with a “crying woman” came from Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)34. Murray creates TAT in 1935, which is used in psychological counseling and psychotherapy at present. In this task, participants are told to describe these four pictures freely.” |

The tasks included: 1. Watching film clips: Three short film segments around 90 s each, one positive, another neutral, and the other negative, were disciplinarily presented. Participants were asked to watch the film clip and then describe their mood. The clips had previously been rated for their affective content (Gross and Levenson, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102822/#B18). The positive film clip is excerpted from cartoon “Larva Funny Bugs,” the neutral film clip is excerpted from the documentary “Universe Millennium,” and the negative film clip is excerpted from the movie “October Siege.” The synchronized start of the stimuli with the recording enabled us to draw a correlation between facial activity and the stimuli. 2. Replying to nine free-response questions: Each participant was requested to respond to nine specific questions (three positives, three neutrals, and three negatives). These questions are designed based on DSM-IV and other depression scales such as the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102822/#fn0002. Questions included, for instance, “what kind of lifestyle do you like?” “discuss a sad childhood memory,” and “please evaluate yourself.” The answers were synchronized with the facial activity recorded. 3. Reading three phonetically balanced passages containing affective content: The participants were presented with a paragraph of text on a computer screen and asked to finish the reading as naturally as possible. There are three reading materials. One of passages contained positive words (e.g., glorious, victory), and the other contained negative words (e.g., heart-broken, pain), which were selected from affective the ontology corpus created by Hongfei Linhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102822/#fn0003. The last one included neutral words (e.g., village, center) selected from the extremum table of affective Chinese words (Gong et al., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102822/#B16). The reading and recording commenced synchronously. 4. Describing pictures: The picture description section is to present 6 pictures in sequence on the computer screen. The first three pictures are facial expression pictures of three women divided into positive, neutral, and negative, and the last three pictures are three scene pictures divided into positive, neutral, and negative. All pictures were selected from the Chinese Facial Affective Picture System (CFAPS) (Gong et al., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102822/#B16).

Our study included four other commands that participants would say in response to Alexa, including “yes” and “pause.” This yielded a total of 34 accepted commands. A complete list of commands and the protocol can be found in the previous work [7].”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | No             | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This would support the comparison across speech-sampling methods and across studies using the same protocol. Second, we wanted to select discourse tasks and methods that would overlap with those used in the AphasiaBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171844/#bib46), TBIBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171844/#bib68), and RHDBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171844/#bib47) protocols to allow for comparisons across patient populations. Third, we wanted to be mindful of participants' time and effort constraints, so we limited the administration time for the discourse protocol to approximately 20 min. Fourth, we wanted to select tasks that could be flexibly administered in-person or remotely via videoconference.

The selected text combines several characteristics. On the one hand, many speakers could reproduce it by heart, especially the beginning of the text, which already forms part of the encyclopedic knowledge of the European Spanish society. On the other hand, the text combines high-frequent terms (salad, cloth, shoes) and low-frequent terms (lancerack, buckler, hack), many of which are semantically specific (lentils, greyhound, marketplace) and form syntactically complex utterances including relative propositions, complex subjects and objects, and an evident sentence nominalization. In this way, the text allows us to control for semantic load, which is important for speech control and monitoring, especially in the second part of the text which is less familiar to the speakers. In this respect, the text includes very familiar elements and highly non-familiar elements, responsible for strained fluency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes            | “Reading corpora offer an extraordinary useful type of data for automatic speech analysis, which currently makes one of the most promising technique in preclinical assessment of AD. “  Moreover, in the paper there is a section that states: “3. Reading-based protocol for speech assessment in Alzheimer’s disease” which provides reasons for the choice of this discourse type. The first sentence reports: “As a cognitive task, reading can offer highly valuable information for early discrimination among nodMCI and preAD. Speakers with AD have been argued to preserve reading ability because of its high degree of automatization as a process. Even though speakers with moderate and severe AD can show reading disfluencies, reading ability is usually preserved across all stages, with the sole diminishing in the extension of the utterances AD speakers can read (Martínez-Sanchez et al., 2013).“                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
